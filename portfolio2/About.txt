Notes:
Replace placeholder text ([Your Profession], [Your Interests], etc.) with your actual information.
Update the paths of images and videos (e.g., avatar.jpg, project1.jpg, etc.) with your actual media files.
Customize styles in the CSS file to match your branding or aesthetic preferences.
You can also incorporate JavaScript if you need additional interactivity (e.g., modal windows for project details).
