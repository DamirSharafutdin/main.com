Explanation:
HTML Structure: The webpage has a main container for project buttons, each representing a unique project. Clicking on a button opens a modal with detailed information about the project.

CSS Styles: The styles ensure the project buttons look good and the modal is user-friendly.

JavaScript Functionality: 

The projects array stores the information for each project.
The openModal() function is triggered when a project button is clicked, populating the modal with the corresponding project's details.
The closeModal() function closes the modal.
Usage:
To display actual images and videos, replace placeholders (like project1.jpg, project1_img1.jpg) with real image paths and provided video links accordingly.
