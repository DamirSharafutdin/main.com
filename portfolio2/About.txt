Notes:
Replace Placeholder Text: Update the placeholder text and links to your own details, including your name, profession, email, project details, etc.
Media Files: Ensure you replace the media files (avatar.jpg, projectX-thumbnail.jpg, etc.) with your actual image and video files.
CSS Customization: You can adjust the styles in the CSS file as desired to fit your aesthetic.
Project Counts: You can add more project sections by duplicating the div class="project" and its corresponding div class="project-details" block while updating the IDs and content accordingly.
