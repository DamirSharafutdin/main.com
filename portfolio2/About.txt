This design will allow users to switch between filter options, like 'all' or specific project categories, to view only relevant projects.

Additional Ideas
Project Images: Replace placeholder images (project1.jpg, etc.) with actual images of your projects.
Project Categories: Add data-category attribute to project cards to enable filtering.
Responsive Design: Improve responsiveness on smaller screens by using CSS Grid or Flexbox.
Animated Transitions: Use CSS animations to enhance the filtering experience.
Feel free to customize and enhance this design to better suit your needs!
