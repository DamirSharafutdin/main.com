Explanation:
HTML Structure: The webpage consists of a container where project items are displayed. Each project has a small image and a title.

Modal Implementation: When a project image is clicked, a modal pops up displaying the project's title, description, additional photos, a video, and a link to the source code.

CSS Styling: The CSS is used for basic styling of the page, project items, and modal.

JavaScript Functions:

openModal: This function is triggered when an image is clicked. It populates the modal with the project's information and displays it.
closeModal: This function hides the modal when invoked.
Dependencies:
Replace the placeholder images (small-photo1.jpg, photo1a.jpg, etc.) and video files with actual paths to your project assets. You can also expand this code further based on your requirements.
